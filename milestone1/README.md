This folder is seeded with the Milestone 1 instructions. 

THis is my solution of Mini data analysis milestone 1.

There are two file in this folder:

A .Rmd file contains my codes and comments.
A .md file for marking. The .md file is a GitHub-friendly format and it is directly knited from the .rmd file.
