THis is my solution of Mini data analysis milestone 2.

There are three file in this folder:
 + A .Rmd file contains my codes and comments.
 + A .md file for marking. The .md file is a GitHub-friendly format and it is directly knited from the .rmd file.
 + My_data file is in the  format of `.RDS`. It is the version of dataset that I will use in milestone 3.
